# NE-Bot
a bot that scans newegg for specific products availability

this bot is supposed to checkout only newegg product pages and is written in python.
in order to run it you need to install python interperter. if you are on windows 10 then it is suggested to install it from the microsoft store:
>open the store
>search "python"
>install any version (i used version 3.8)

once installed all you need is to open the CMD and write:
python "PATH" (ex. python "C:\New Folder\bot - edit.py")

python is an inline interpreter coding language so the code executed can be viewed and edited with a simple text viewer like the windows' notepad on the fly.

there are 2 files:
bot D version: all info is collected via prompts and that info is lost once the program is terminated.
bot - edit: all info should be added to the code via text editor and so it persists, i recommend visual studio code with python plugin.

the links should be writted like so:
"https://www.newegg.com/global/il-en/pny-geforce-rtx-3080-vcg308010tfxmpb/p/N82E16814133810"

if you want it to check another site like amazon or ebay you are welcome to do it yourselves. but you probably need to change the code just a bit.
